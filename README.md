Citi Bike Analytics

Created a Tableau story report with a detailed and annotated analysis of the public New York Citi Bike data set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) found here: (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). Story report addresses topics such as total ridership and proportion of short-term customers versus annual subscribers, peak usage hours, most and least popular stations, trip duration, and age and gender demographics. Also included are static and dynamic maps showing bike station locations and usage overlaid on a map of the city of New York.
